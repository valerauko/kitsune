# Kitsune ðŸ¦Š

>Very fox microblogging

Kitsune is an ActivityPub-speaking microblogging service. It is tested to federate with [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/) and [Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/) instances at the very least.

Alas it's not "production ready" yet. Check back later.

## Tech stack

Clojure.

Still experimenting. Check back later.

## Older versions

I decided to revisit Kitsune and start from scratch, instead preserving [the old repository](https://github.com/valerauko/kitsune-alpha) (which dates back to 2018) as an archive.
